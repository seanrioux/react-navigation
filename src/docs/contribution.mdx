# Contribution guide

## Git

Contributors should work from the latest version branch in development (indicated using format `v0.1.0`).

Pull requests will be reviewed for contribution to future releases.

## Development

The easiest way to get started is via the included Docz site. Docz is a React based static site generator for documentation. It uses mdx.

Using Docz we have components in a living style guide. To run Docz locally for development:

```
npm install
npm run docz:dev
```

To run a build of the Docz site:

```
npm run docz:build
```

To build and serve a Docz site:

```
npm run docz:serve
```

## Build

Builds for distribution are via Webpack. To test your builds, you can:

```
npm run build
```

Builds are distributed via npm.
